    <p>Hi everyone! I'm really excited to be here with you all. 
    <p>So, a little bit about myself, I am Jamaican and I throughly enjoy going on adventures with family and friends.</p>
    <p>I have always had a nack for all things techy, however, due to various challenges I was unable to complete a degree.</p>
    <p>But a distant relative introduced me to BYU Pathway and here I am!</p>
    <p>I am aiming for a bachelor's degree in software development and I'm looking forward to working with everyone.</p>
